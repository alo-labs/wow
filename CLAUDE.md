# wordpress-optimization — Claude Code Instructions

> **Always adhere strictly to this file — it overrides all defaults.**

---

## 0. Session Startup (Automatic)

At the very start of any new session, perform these steps automatically:

1. **Switch to Opus 4.6 (1M context)** if not already selected.
2. **Read all project docs** — this file and 100% of docs/.
3. **Compact the context** — run /compact to free context for the task.
4. **Switch back to original model** if it was changed in step 1.

---

## Project Overview

- **Stack**: PHP/WordPress
- **Git repo**: NONE

---

## 1. Automated Enforcement

Six layers enforce compliance:

1. **PostToolUse — Skill tracker** — Records every skill invocation
2. **PostToolUse — Stage enforcer** — HARD STOP if planning incomplete
3. **PostToolUse — Compliance status** — Shows progress on every tool use
4. **PostToolUse — Completion audit** — Blocks commit/push/deploy if incomplete
5. **Redundant instructions** — Workflow file + CLAUDE.md both enforce rules
6. **Anti-rationalization** — Explicit rules against skipping/combining steps

**Trivial changes** (typos, copy fixes, config tweaks): Automatically
detected by hooks. Small edits (<300 chars) and non-logic files (.json,
.yml, .md, .css, etc.) skip enforcement per-edit. No action needed.

**Subagent commits**: Every git commit MUST use HEREDOC format and end with:
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

---

## 2. Active Workflow

The active workflow is loaded from `docs/workflows/`. Claude MUST read
the active workflow file before starting any non-trivial task.

**Default**: `docs/workflows/full-dev-cycle.md`

**Skill not found rule**: If a skill listed in the workflow cannot be
invoked, STOP and notify the user immediately. Do NOT silently skip.

---

## 3. NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

These rules apply to EVERY non-trivial change. There are NO exceptions.

You MUST NOT:
- Skip a REQUIRED step because "it's simple enough"
- Combine or implicitly cover steps ("I did code review while writing")
- Claim a step is "not applicable" without explicit user approval
- Proceed to the next phase before completing the current phase
- Claim work is complete without running /verification-before-completion

If you believe a step is genuinely not applicable, you MUST:
1. State which step you want to skip
2. State why
3. Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding

"I already covered this" is NOT valid. Each skill MUST be explicitly
invoked via the Skill tool — implicit coverage does not count because
the enforcement hooks track Skill tool invocations, not your judgment.

**Rules**:
- Do NOT stop until the final outcome is achieved
- Always use /systematic-debugging + /debug for ANY bug
- Always strictly adhere to this CLAUDE.md 100%
